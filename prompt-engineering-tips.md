- Provide specific examples if possible.

## 2. Use Step-by-Step Instructions
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps.

- Include relevant background information.

## 4. Experiment with Different Phrasings
- Try different ways of phrasing your prompt.
- See which version yields the best results.

## 5. Use Constraints
- Set boundaries for the model's responses.
- Specify any limitations or rules.

## 6. Iterate and Refine
- Continuously refine your prompts based on the model's output.
- Make adjustments to improve accuracy and relevance.

## 7. Leverage Examples
- Provide positive and negative examples.
- Show the model what to do and what to avoid.

## 8. Test with Edge Cases
- Test your prompts with edge cases to ensure robustness.
- Identify and address any weaknesses.

## 9. Use System Messages
